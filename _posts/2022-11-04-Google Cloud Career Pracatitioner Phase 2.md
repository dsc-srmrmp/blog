> Due to limitations from Google, we are only able to accommodate `100 participants`. But since we got only less than 100 participants, Google is giving us a opportunity again to registe in the program on Nov 11 9 AM. Google will open 10,000 tickets to the GDSC's which are not to be shared as before. Since i got message and since many people asked me IRL i am considering to give it to people who didnt register previously
