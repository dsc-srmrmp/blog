<h1>Google Cloud Career Pracatitioner 2022</h1>
This is a program from `Google Cloud` mainly focusing on the learning part of the Google cloud unlike the `#30DaysOfGoogleCloud`. This program is mainly based on [Cloud Engineering Learning Path](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/11) which will lead us to be a Google cloud expert and will give us to proficiency to be abled to write the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer certification. This is very much valuable certificate which can be used as a big step in your professional journey.

<h3>What do I need to do to be a part of this program?</h3>
> Due to limitations from Google, we are only able to accommodate `100 participants`. But anyone can apply to this program and we will filter out and select some participants that deserve it and are worth it. This is purely based on skill and previous works and we will be selecting people with some basic criteria only. This is will be a fair selection on the same base for the same leveled game for all applicants.

<h3>Will I be given any special access?</h3>
> As said before, we will not give any special access/permission for anyone to get into this program and this will purely be based on the selection committee which will select you after reviewing all the applicants.

<h3>Will I get schwag for this event?</h3>
> No, we don't promise any schwag for now nor does Google so we cant assure you anything as of now.

<h3>What do I need as a part of this program?</h3>
> First of all, you need a ton of `patience`, a reasonable amount of `patience` and some `free time` alone with `an internet connection`.

##### Why only `100 Participants`?
> For some reason, Google chooses to have only 100 participants (This will sum up to a total of 50K from all GDSCs in India). And Google made sure that there are no more than 100 registration from each college else Google will reject the whole GDSC, which will cause the whole GDSC and the 100 participants in the GDSC to be out of the program. We highly encourage you to follow this as well and coordinate and understand us.
