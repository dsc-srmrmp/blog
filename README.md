## WHAT IS HACKTOBER?
A month-long celebration from October 1st - 31st sponsored by Digital Ocean and GitHub to get people involved in Open Source. Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community and also get some cool swags!

## WHY OPENSOURCE?
Open-sourcing is a cost-effective way of contributing to projects. Opensource makes it possible to have fewer bugs and faster fixes. People are always looking for flaws to fix. Oh and also you get some cool swags for your contributions ðŸ‘€

## NEW HERE?
